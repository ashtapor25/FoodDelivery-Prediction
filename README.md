## Introduction
We started out this project thinking that it might help small shop owners who rely on delivery orders for their sales. Thanks to SK bigdatahub, we had about 5 years of data to train and test on. We analyzed the data to figure out what caused the variations in delivery volume over each day. We tried to correlate exterior data such as weather and stock index values to further improve performance. If you have any questions, please contact one of us via email.
